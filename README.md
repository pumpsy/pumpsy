## Introduction

Inflating things without control can be annoying, especially when you worked so hard to make that inflatable actuator and then it just explodes. Pumpsy is a smart pump that can prevent that. It allows to set a pressure limit dynamically and it remembers it even after a power-off.

## OK I Want One

Yes, you can have one more, but you will have to support the project in one way or another. What we offer at the moment is the following.

1. Personal Non-Commercial Licensing
2. Per-Event Licensing

### Personal Non-Commercial Licensing

You want to test it first and would like to get your hands on the device. We accept donations, interesting contributions and merch purchases in exchange for access to our design file repository.

### Per-Event Licensing

If you like Pumpsy, you would probably want to use it for an event, such as workshop or hackathon. This is possible, and Pumpsy will be a valuable component of your project's way to success! You can make Pumpsy a success by allocating a percentage of your event's revenue to Pumpsy. If you can afford a videographer to document your event, it means you can support Pumpsy!

## Get Started

So you want to get started with Pumpsy? We know you do. Open an issue briefly describing why you need Pumpsy and we will get back to you with further details.

Sincerely,

Pumpsy
